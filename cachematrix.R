## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your functions do

##makeCacheMatrix (mCM) creates special type of variable (list) that is capable of capturing own value as well as its inverse
##cacheSolver is function that checks whether inverse is already computed.
        ## IF YES --> prints computed value
        ## IF NO  --> calculates inverse, and assign it in (mCM)-inverse list

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv <- NULL # when creating new (mCM) inverse is not computed yet
        set <- function(y) {  #set function allows to change value of (mCM)-source
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL  #reset inverse as not computed, as original matrix changed
        }
        get <- function() x   #returns value of (mCM)-source
        setinv <- function(i) inv <<- i  #assigns externally computed inverse to (mCM)-inverse
        getinv <- function() inv  #returns NULL if inverse is not comuted yet or inverse if it is computed
        list(set = set, get = get,
                setinv = setinv,
                getinv = getinv)
